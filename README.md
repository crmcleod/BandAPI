# Machine Head API

## About
I initially started this project to create an API of my favourite bands. After seeding in 30 years worth of songs from one band, I decided that this worked nicely enough for just one band, Machine Head. Goodbye 'bands API', hello 'Machine Head API'.

This was a chance to look at Java/Spring again and to look at using Docker and AWS to host it.

There are 4 different routes available:
* [All](http://3.129.7.160:8080/bands)
* [Members](http://3.129.7.160:8080/members)
* [Albums](http://3.129.7.160:8080/albums)
* [Songs](http://3.129.7.160:8080/songs)
